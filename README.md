## The Problem

### For Solo Developers

Building software alone is hard. You're expected to be an expert in architecture, security, testing, UX, accessibility, DevOps, and more—all at once. AI assistants help, but they:

- **Forget everything** between sessions (wasted tokens rebuilding context)
- **Give generic advice** (no specialized expertise for complex decisions)
- **Lack process** (ad-hoc responses instead of proven workflows)

### For Teams

Working on a team is just as hard. You're expected to share knowledge, align on standards, and think consistently—but reality looks different:

- **Knowledge stays siloed** — What one engineer learns doesn't transfer to others
- **Standards exist but aren't followed** — Documentation sits in wikis nobody reads
- **Onboarding takes months** — New hires slowly absorb "how we do things here" through osmosis
- **Institutional knowledge walks out the door** — When people leave, their expertise leaves with them
- **AI amplifies inconsistency** — Everyone prompts differently, gets different quality, makes different mistakes
- **No compound learning** — The team makes the same mistakes repeatedly because lessons aren't encoded anywhere

### The Strategic Gap

Even when teams overcome these challenges, a bigger problem remains:

- **Engineers build what's specified, not what's needed** — No one advocates for the user during implementation
- **Design and development speak different languages** — Intent gets lost in translation
- **Security, accessibility, and quality are afterthoughts** — Bolted on at the end instead of built in from the start
- **AI tools optimize locally, not globally** — They help with the task at hand but miss the bigger picture

## The Solution

Claude Copilot transforms Claude Code into a **complete development environment** with:

| Challenge | Solution | Result |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Lost context | **Memory Copilot** persists decisions, lessons, and progress | Pick up exactly where you left off |
| Generic advice | **11 Specialized Agents** with deep domain expertise | Expert guidance for every task type |
| No process | **Protocol Commands** enforce proven workflows | Consistent quality, nothing missed |
| One-size-fits-all | **Your Knowledge, Encoded** — override agents, add private skills, define your methodologies | Your team's standards, applied everywhere |

         ├──→ @agent-cpa (tax categories, compliance rules) │  ← Your custom agent
         │         │                                         │
         │         └──→ returns IRS category mappings        │
         │                                                   │
         └──→ @agent-me (implementation) ◄──────────────────┘
                   │
                   ├──→ @agent-sec (financial data protection)
                   │
                   └──→ @agent-cpa (validates tax logic)     ← Called again for review
```

Your CPA agent encodes tax law expertise, IRS requirements, and accounting standards—knowledge that doesn't exist in generic AI tools.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "copilot-memory": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["~/.claude/copilot/mcp-servers/copilot-memory/dist/index.js"]
    },
    "skills-copilot": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["~/.claude/copilot/mcp-servers/skills-copilot/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

**What works offline:**
- All 11 agents
- Memory persistence (local SQLite)
- Local project skills
- `/protocol` and `/continue` commands

### Full Setup (With External Services)

For access to 25,000+ public skills and team-shared private skills:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "copilot-memory": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["~/.claude/copilot/mcp-servers/copilot-memory/dist/index.js"]
    },
    "skills-copilot": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["~/.claude/copilot/mcp-servers/skills-copilot/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "SKILLSMP_API_KEY": "sk_live_skillsmp_your_key_here",
        "POSTGRES_URL": "postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/database"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

## External Services Setup

### Skill Marketplace (SkillsMP)

[Skill Marketplace](https://skillsmp.com) is a platform for discovering, sharing, and managing AI skills. Think of it as an "app store" for AI capabilities—curated prompts, workflows, and domain expertise packaged as reusable skills that any AI agent can load on demand.

**What Skill Marketplace provides:**
- **25,000+ public skills** for frameworks, languages, and best practices
- **Community-curated content** maintained by developers and domain experts
- **Semantic search** to find the right skill for any task
- **Version management** so skills improve over time
- **Private repositories** for teams to share proprietary skills

**To get your API key:**

1. Visit [skillsmp.com](https://skillsmp.com)
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Navigate to Settings → API Keys
4. Generate a new API key
5. Add to your `.mcp.json` as `SKILLSMP_API_KEY`

**Example skills available:**
- Framework patterns (React, Next.js, Laravel, Rails, Django, etc.)
- Language idioms and best practices
- Security checklists and compliance guides
- Design system implementations
- API design standards

### PostgreSQL (Private/Team Skills)

For teams that want to share proprietary skills, methodologies, or company standards.

**Option 1: Managed PostgreSQL (Recommended)**

| Provider | Free Tier | Setup Time |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| [Supabase](https://supabase.com) | 500MB | 5 minutes |
| [Neon](https://neon.tech) | 512MB | 5 minutes |
| [Railway](https://railway.app) | $5 credit | 5 minutes |

**Setup steps:**

1. Create account at your chosen provider
2. Create a new PostgreSQL database
3. Get your connection string (format: `postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db`)
4. Run the schema migration:
   ```bash
   psql "your_connection_string" -f ~/.claude/copilot/mcp-servers/skills-copilot/schema.sql
   ```
5. Add `POSTGRES_URL` to your `.mcp.json`

**Option 2: Self-Hosted PostgreSQL**

```bash
# Using Docker
docker run -d \
  --name skills-db \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=yourpassword \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  postgres:15

# Run migrations
psql -h localhost -U postgres -f ~/.claude/copilot/mcp-servers/skills-copilot/schema.sql
```

**Saving private skills:**

```
skill_save({
  name: "company-api-standards",
  description: "Our REST API design standards",
  content: "Your skill content here...",
  category: "architecture",
  keywords: ["api", "rest", "standards"],
  isProprietary: true
})
```

---

## Making It Yours

The base framework works immediately. These customizations let teams encode their own standards.

### Three Ways to Customize

| Method | Effort | Best For |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Private Skills** | Low | Encoding patterns, standards, checklists |
| **Agent Extensions** | Medium | Adding to existing agent capabilities |
| **Agent Overrides** | High | Replacing methodologies entirely |

### Quick Start: Private Skills

The fastest way to customize. No code changes required.

```javascript
// Save a skill via Skills Copilot
skill_save({
  name: "our-api-standards",
  description: "REST API design standards for our team",
  content: "Your standards in markdown...",
  keywords: ["api", "rest", "standards"],
  isProprietary: true
})
```

Now any agent can load `our-api-standards` when working on APIs.

### Knowledge Repositories

For deeper customization, create a knowledge repository:

```
your-knowledge-repo/
├── knowledge-manifest.json    # Declares what you're customizing
├── extensions/
│   ├── ta.md                  # Override Tech Architect methodology
│   └── sec.md                 # Extend Security agent
└── skills/
    └── your-skills.md         # Additional skills
```

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Claude Copilot (Base Framework)       │
│  Industry-standard methodologies       │
│  Works for any developer               │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
                    │
                    ▼ your customizations extend
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Your Knowledge Repository             │
│  Company-specific methodologies        │
│  Proprietary skills & standards        │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Extension Types

| Type | Behavior | Use Case |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Override** | Replaces base agent entirely | Your architecture methodology is fundamentally different |

## Session Management

### Starting Fresh

```bash
/protocol
```

Activates the **Agent-First Protocol**:
1. Every response starts with a protocol declaration
2. Requests are classified and routed to the right agent
3. Agents investigate before presenting solutions
4. You approve before execution

### Resuming Work

```bash
/continue
```

Loads from **Memory Copilot**:
- Current initiative and status
- What you've completed
- What's in progress
- Decisions made and why
- Lessons learned
- Exactly where to pick up

### End of Session

Memory Copilot automatically stores:
- Tasks completed
- Current progress
- Key files touched
- Decisions and rationale
- Lessons learned
- Resume instructions for next time

## Philosophy

### Every Developer Deserves a Team

Solo developers shouldn't have to be experts in architecture, security, testing, UX, accessibility, DevOps, and documentation all at once. Claude Copilot gives you access to specialized expertise when you need it.

### Human Advocates Have Equal Standing

The "Human Advocate" agents (Service Designer, UX Designer, UI Designer, UI Developer, Copywriter) aren't secondary to technical agents. Software exists to serve humans—these agents ensure that happens.

### Memory That Persists

Your context shouldn't evaporate between sessions. Decisions, lessons, and progress persist so you never waste tokens rebuilding context.

### Skills On Demand

Load specialized knowledge when you need it, not as bloated context at the start of every session. 25,000+ skills available, each loaded only when relevant.

### Your Standards, Not Ours

Claude Copilot ships with industry-standard methodologies—but your team isn't generic. Override any agent with your architecture standards. Add skills encoding your API patterns. Non-developers can contribute too: your UX team's research methods, your content team's voice guidelines, your security team's compliance requirements.

The framework adapts to you. Not the other way around.

## Requirements

| Component | Required | Optional |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Node.js 18+ | Yes | - |
| Claude Code CLI | Yes | - |
| Build tools | Yes | - |
| ~300MB disk space | Yes | - |
| Skill Marketplace API key | No | Enables 25K+ public skills |
| PostgreSQL | No | Enables team-shared private skills |
| Internet connection | No | Only for external skills |

## Troubleshooting

### Build fails with native module errors

```bash
# macOS
xcode-select --install

# Linux
sudo apt-get install build-essential python3

# Then rebuild
cd ~/.claude/copilot/mcp-servers/copilot-memory
npm rebuild better-sqlite3
```

### MCP servers not connecting

1. Ensure servers are built: check for `dist/` folders
2. Restart Claude Code after config changes
3. Check paths in `.mcp.json` are absolute or use `~`

### Memory not persisting

- Memory is project-scoped (per directory)
- Check `~/.claude/memory/` for database files
- Ensure write permissions on the directory
