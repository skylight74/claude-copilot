## Inspiration & Patterns

### Ralph Wiggum Iteration Pattern
**Source:** [github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/plugins/ralph-wiggum](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/plugins/ralph-wiggum)

The iteration loop system in Task Copilot (Phase 2) is inspired by the Ralph Wiggum plugin's self-referential feedback loop pattern. This pattern enables autonomous, iterative task completion with intelligent stop conditions.

**Source:** [github.com/luongnv89/claude-howto](https://github.com/luongnv89/claude-howto)
**Author:** [luongnv89](https://github.com/luongnv89)

Comprehensive Claude Code documentation and learning materials. Content has been incorporated into `docs/claude-howto-reference/` with permission. The multi-entry-point documentation approach significantly influenced our onboarding improvements.

### Alex's Claude Code Customization Guide
**Source:** [alexop.dev/posts/claude-code-customization-guide-claudemd-skills-subagents/](https://alexop.dev/posts/claude-code-customization-guide-claudemd-skills-subagents/)
**Author:** Alex

This detailed blog post on Claude Code customization patterns informed our documentation strategy and helped identify key developer needs around CLAUDE.md, skills, and subagents.

### Agent Skills for Context Engineering
**Source:** [github.com/muratcankoylan/Agent-Skills-for-Context-Engineering](https://github.com/muratcankoylan/Agent-Skills-for-Context-Engineering)
**Author:** [muratcankoylan](https://github.com/muratcankoylan)

Comprehensive research on context engineering principles including attention budget awareness, the "lost-in-the-middle" phenomenon, and progressive disclosure patterns. This research directly informed our Attention Budget guidance in agent templates and work product compression strategies.

**Key Learnings:**
- Context windows are constrained by attention mechanics, not just token capacity
- U-shaped attention curves (high attention at start/end, low in middle)
- Front-loading critical decisions and back-loading action items
- Table-first writing for 25-50% token savings

### Awesome Agent Skills
**Source:** [github.com/heilcheng/awesome-agent-skills](https://github.com/heilcheng/awesome-agent-skills)
**Author:** [heilcheng](https://github.com/heilcheng)

Curated collection of AI agent skills with standardized SKILL.md format guidelines. This resource informed our skill size validation (500-line maximum) and progressive loading design (3-tier: index → summary → full).

**Key Learnings:**
- Skills as instruction bundles, not executable code
- 500-line maximum for maintainability
- Three-stage loading pattern for token efficiency
- Community contribution patterns for skill ecosystems

### Spec Kit
**Source:** [github.com/github/spec-kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit)
**Author:** GitHub

Open-source toolkit for Spec-Driven Development introducing the "Constitution" concept for project governance. This directly inspired our CONSTITUTION.md template for defining project values, constraints, and decision authority.

**Key Learnings:**
- Constitution as persistent governance principles
- Separation of "what" (Constitution) from "how" (framework mechanics)
- 7-step workflow: Constitution → Specification → Clarification → Planning → Tasks → Implementation → Validation
- Agent-agnostic design patterns

## Context Engineering Research

The following projects provided key insights for our context engineering enhancements, including auto-compaction, continuation enforcement, and activation modes.

### Oh My OpenCode
**Source:** [github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-opencode](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-opencode)
**Author:** [code-yeongyu](https://github.com/code-yeongyu)

An advanced agent harness for OpenCode with multi-agent orchestration and parallel execution. The project's disciplined approach to context management directly influenced our auto-compaction and continuation enforcement features.

**Key Learnings:**
- Todo Continuation Enforcer pattern (prevents agents from stopping mid-task)
- 85% context threshold for preemptive compaction
- Aggressive delegation to specialized agents
- Context intelligence strategies (dynamic pruning, tool output truncation)

### MCP Shrimp Task Manager
**Source:** [github.com/cjo4m06/mcp-shrimp-task-manager](https://github.com/cjo4m06/mcp-shrimp-task-manager)
**Author:** [cjo4m06](https://github.com/cjo4m06)

A task management tool for AI agents emphasizing chain-of-thought, reflection, and style consistency. The structured workflow approach influenced our quality gates and project rules implementation.

**Key Learnings:**
- Persistent memory patterns for tasks across sessions
- Project rules initialization workflow
- Research mode for systematic exploration
- Smart task decomposition with dependency tracking

### BMAD Method
**Source:** [github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD)
**Author:** [bmad-code-org](https://github.com/bmad-code-org)

Breakthrough Method for Agile AI Driven Development with 21 specialized agents and 50+ guided workflows. The agent customization patterns informed our extension system and activation modes.

**Key Learnings:**
- Agent customization without modifying core files
- Keyword-based activation modes for different work intensities
- Battle-tested workflows for agile development
- Expansion pack isolation patterns

### Get Shit Done (GSD)
**Source:** [github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done](https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done)
**Author:** [glittercowboy](https://github.com/glittercowboy)

A productivity-focused Claude Code configuration emphasizing execution over planning. GSD's pragmatic approach to developer experience directly inspired five enhancements in Task Copilot v1.8:

**Key Learnings:**
- **Verification Enforcement**: Require proof of completion before marking tasks done
- **Atomic Execution Modes**: "Ultrawork" mode for quick tasks with subtask limits
- **Progress Visibility**: ASCII progress bars and velocity tracking
- **Enhanced Pause/Resume**: Named checkpoints with extended expiry for context switching
- **Codebase Mapping**: Project structure analysis for faster agent navigation

The GSD philosophy of "bias toward action" influenced our shift from passive task tracking to active execution enforcement.
