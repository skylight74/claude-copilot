## Inspiration & Patterns

### Effective Harnesses for Long-Running Agents
**Source:** [anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents)
**Author:** Anthropic Engineering

Anthropic's engineering guide on building harnesses for long-running agents directly inspired our v1.8 harness enhancements. The article's two-agent architecture (initializer + coding agent), session boundary protocols, and git-as-checkpoint patterns were implemented in Task Copilot.

**Key Learnings:**
- Two-agent separation: initializer creates immutable feature list, worker executes
- Session startup ritual: verify environment before starting work
- Progress files as handoff documentation between agent sessions
- Git commits as recovery checkpoints for multi-session work
- "Early victory declaration" failure mode and mitigations

### AutoCoder
**Source:** [github.com/leonvanzyl/autocoder](https://github.com/leonvanzyl/autocoder)
**Author:** [leonvanzyl](https://github.com/leonvanzyl)

A long-running autonomous coding agent built on Claude Agent SDK. AutoCoder's elegant approach to session continuity via SQLite state persistence (rather than context window) directly influenced our Task Copilot architecture.

**Key Learnings:**
- SQLite-based feature tracking for multi-session progress
- MCP tools for feature status (`feature_get_next`, `feature_mark_passing`)
- Pause/resume via process restart with durable state
- WebSocket real-time streaming for progress visibility
- Regression testing integration during autonomous builds

### Automaker
**Source:** [github.com/AutoMaker-Org/automaker](https://github.com/AutoMaker-Org/automaker)
**Author:** [AutoMaker-Org](https://github.com/AutoMaker-Org)

AI-powered development studio with visual Kanban interface for non-developers. Automaker's git worktree isolation pattern and plan approval workflow inspired our v1.8 worktree integration and scope locking features.

**Key Learnings:**
- Git worktree isolation per feature (protected main branch)
- Plan approval workflow (human-in-the-loop before execution)
- Event-driven WebSocket streaming architecture
- Visual task management for non-technical users
- Multi-agent task execution with focused problem-solving

### Ralph Wiggum Iteration Pattern
**Source:** [github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/plugins/ralph-wiggum](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/plugins/ralph-wiggum)

The iteration loop system in Task Copilot (Phase 2) is inspired by the Ralph Wiggum plugin's self-referential feedback loop pattern. This pattern enables autonomous, iterative task completion with intelligent stop conditions.

### claude-howto
**Source:** [github.com/luongnv89/claude-howto](https://github.com/luongnv89/claude-howto)
**Author:** [luongnv89](https://github.com/luongnv89)

### Alex's Claude Code Customization Guide
**Source:** [alexop.dev/posts/claude-code-customization-guide-claudemd-skills-subagents/](https://alexop.dev/posts/claude-code-customization-guide-claudemd-skills-subagents/)
**Author:** Alex

This detailed blog post on Claude Code customization patterns informed our documentation strategy and helped identify key developer needs around CLAUDE.md, skills, and subagents.

### Agent Skills for Context Engineering
**Source:** [github.com/muratcankoylan/Agent-Skills-for-Context-Engineering](https://github.com/muratcankoylan/Agent-Skills-for-Context-Engineering)
**Author:** [muratcankoylan](https://github.com/muratcankoylan)

Comprehensive research on context engineering principles including attention budget awareness, the "lost-in-the-middle" phenomenon, and progressive disclosure patterns. This research directly informed our Attention Budget guidance in agent templates and work product compression strategies.

**Key Learnings:**
- Context windows are constrained by attention mechanics, not just token capacity
- U-shaped attention curves (high attention at start/end, low in middle)
- Front-loading critical decisions and back-loading action items
- Table-first writing for 25-50% token savings

### Lean Agent + Deep Skills Architecture
**Pattern Source:** Anthropic's agent design patterns and the broader AI agent community

The "lean agent with external expertise" pattern emerged from multiple sources in the AI agent ecosystem:

**Core Pattern:**
- Slim agent definitions (~60-100 lines) focusing on workflow and routing
- Domain expertise moved to loadable skill files (200-500 lines)
- Context-aware skill selection via evaluation systems
- On-demand loading reduces baseline token usage by 67%

**Influence Sources:**
- **Anthropic's MCP and Agent Patterns**: The Model Context Protocol documentation and agent design guides emphasize minimal agent definitions with external tool/resource access
- **Agent Skills for Context Engineering**: Progressive disclosure and attention budget optimization
- **Awesome Agent Skills**: Standardized skill format and size limits (500-line maximum)
- **Community Best Practices**: Pattern observed across claude-howto, Oh My OpenCode, and BMAD Method

This architectural pattern allows agents to remain lightweight while accessing deep domain knowledge only when needed, significantly improving context efficiency and agent maintainability.

**Our Implementation:**
- `skill_evaluate()` tool for automatic skill detection (file patterns + keyword matching)
- TF-IDF-based confidence scoring for skill relevance
- Native `@include` support for zero-overhead skill loading
- Optional MCP integration for marketplace skills (25K+ public skills)

### Awesome Agent Skills
**Source:** [github.com/heilcheng/awesome-agent-skills](https://github.com/heilcheng/awesome-agent-skills)
**Author:** [heilcheng](https://github.com/heilcheng)

Curated collection of AI agent skills with standardized SKILL.md format guidelines. This resource informed our skill size validation (500-line maximum) and progressive loading design (3-tier: index → summary → full).

**Key Learnings:**
- Skills as instruction bundles, not executable code
- 500-line maximum for maintainability
- Three-stage loading pattern for token efficiency
- Community contribution patterns for skill ecosystems

### Spec Kit
**Source:** [github.com/github/spec-kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit)
**Author:** GitHub

Open-source toolkit for Spec-Driven Development introducing the "Constitution" concept for project governance. This directly inspired our CONSTITUTION.md template for defining project values, constraints, and decision authority.

**Key Learnings:**
- Constitution as persistent governance principles
- Separation of "what" (Constitution) from "how" (framework mechanics)
- 7-step workflow: Constitution → Specification → Clarification → Planning → Tasks → Implementation → Validation
- Agent-agnostic design patterns

### Get Shit Done (GSD)
**Source:** [github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done](https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done)
**Author:** [glittercowboy](https://github.com/glittercowboy)

A productivity-focused Claude Code configuration emphasizing execution over planning. GSD's pragmatic approach to developer experience directly inspired five enhancements in Task Copilot v1.8:

**Key Learnings:**
- **Verification Enforcement**: Require proof of completion before marking tasks done
- **Atomic Execution Modes**: "Ultrawork" mode for quick tasks with subtask limits
- **Progress Visibility**: ASCII progress bars and velocity tracking
- **Enhanced Pause/Resume**: Named checkpoints with extended expiry for context switching
- **Codebase Mapping**: Project structure analysis for faster agent navigation

The GSD philosophy of "bias toward action" influenced our shift from passive task tracking to active execution enforcement.
