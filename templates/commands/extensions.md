# Extensions Status

Show the status of the extension system, including knowledge repositories, active extensions, and setup guidance.

## Step 1: Check Knowledge Repository Status

Call `manifest_status` to get the status of both global and project knowledge repositories.

## Step 2: List Active Extensions

Call `extension_list` to retrieve all active extensions.

## Step 3: Present Status

Based on the results from Steps 1 and 2, present the extension status.

### If extensions are configured:

```
## Knowledge Repositories

### Global (Machine-Level)
Location: ~/.claude/knowledge/
Status: [Configured / Not found]
Name: [manifest name]
Extensions: [count]
Skills: [count]

### Project (This Directory)
Location: [path or "Not configured"]
Status: [Configured / Using global only]
Name: [manifest name if configured]
Extensions: [count if configured]

Resolution Priority: Project > Global > Base agents

## Active Extensions

| Agent | Extension | Type | Source | Description |
|-------|-----------|------|--------|-------------|
| @agent-sd | [name] | override | Global | [description] |
| @agent-uxd | [name] | extension | Project (overrides global) | [description] |
| @agent-ta | (base) | - | Framework | Industry-standard methodologies |

Note: Only agents listed above have extensions. All other agents use base framework instructions.

## Extension Types

### override
Completely replaces the base agent with your methodology.
- Use when: You have a proprietary methodology fundamentally different from base
- Example: Service Designer using Moments Framework instead of Service Blueprinting

### extension
Adds to the base agent (section-level merge).
- Use when: You want base practices plus company-specific additions
- Example: UX Designer with company design system requirements

### skills
Injects additional skills into the agent.
- Use when: You have company-specific tools/patterns to make available
- Example: Tech Architect with company architecture patterns

### If no extensions are configured:

```
## Extension Status

No extensions configured.
Using base framework agents only.

## Knowledge Repository Status

### Global (Machine-Level)
Location: ~/.claude/knowledge/
Status: Not found

### Project (This Directory)
Status: Not configured

## Why Use Extensions?

Extensions customize Claude Copilot agents for your team:
- **Override** agents with proprietary methodologies
- **Extend** agents with company-specific checklists and standards
- **Inject skills** to provide company-specific tools and patterns

This is Claude Copilot's biggest differentiator - bringing your company's expertise into the AI workflow.

## Extension Types

### override
Completely replaces the base agent with your methodology.
Use when: Your methodology is fundamentally different from generic approach.

### extension
Layers company-specific content on top of the base agent.
Use when: You want to keep base practices but add company requirements.

### skills
Adds company-specific skills to an agent without changing behavior.
Use when: You want to provide access to proprietary tools/patterns.

## Get Started

### Option 1: Global Knowledge Repository (Recommended)
Set up once, available in all projects automatically.

Run: /knowledge-copilot

This creates ~/.claude/knowledge/ with:
- knowledge-manifest.json (required)
- .claude/extensions/ (your agent extensions)
- skills/ (company-specific skills)
- docs/ (company glossary, standards)

### Option 2: Project-Specific Knowledge Repository
Only needed when this project requires different extensions than global.

1. Create knowledge repository in your project
2. Add to .mcp.json:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "skills-copilot": {
         "env": {
           "KNOWLEDGE_REPO_PATH": "/path/to/knowledge"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## Two-Tier Resolution

The system checks for extensions in priority order:
1. Project repository (if configured) - highest priority
2. Global repository (~/.claude/knowledge) - auto-detected
3. Base framework agents - always available

Set up global once, override per-project only when needed.

```

### If warnings exist:

If `manifest_status` or `extension_list` includes warnings about missing required skills or fallback behaviors:

```
## Warnings

- @agent-sd extension requires skill "moments-mapping" (not found)
  Fallback: Using base agent with warning

- @agent-uxd extension requires skill "design-system" (not found)
  Fallback: Using base agent silently

To resolve: Add required skills to your knowledge repository or adjust fallbackBehavior in extension frontmatter.
```

## Important

- DO NOT create documentation or files unless explicitly requested
- ONLY show status and guidance
- Present information clearly based on actual extension state
- Include setup instructions appropriate to current state
