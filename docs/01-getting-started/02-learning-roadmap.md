# Claude Copilot Learning Roadmap

**New to Claude Copilot?** This comprehensive guide will help you master the framework progressively, from basic memory persistence to advanced team customization.

---

## Learning Philosophy

This roadmap follows three key principles:

1. **Dependencies** - Build foundational capabilities before advanced features
2. **Value First** - Get immediate productivity wins at each stage
3. **Practical Application** - Learn by doing with copy-paste ready commands

Each milestone delivers tangible value. You can stop at any stage and already have a dramatically improved workflow.

---

## Quick Start Paths

### If You Only Have 15 Minutes
**Goal**: Get memory working so /continue actually works

```bash
# 1. Clone to standard location
mkdir -p ~/.claude && cd ~/.claude
git clone https://github.com/Everyone-Needs-A-Copilot/claude-copilot.git copilot

# 2. Machine setup
cd ~/.claude/copilot && claude
```

Then say:
```
Read @~/.claude/copilot/SETUP.md and set up Claude Copilot on this machine
```

**What you get**: Memory Copilot running - your work persists between sessions.

---

### If You Have 1 Hour
**Goal**: Memory + Protocol + core agents (ta, me, qa)

Follow the 15-minute path, then:

```bash
# Set up a project
cd ~/your-project && claude
```

Run:
```
/setup-project
```

Then try:
```
/protocol
# Say: "I need to add user authentication"
# Watch as ta (Tech Architect) breaks it down
```

**What you get**: Structured workflows with expert guidance.

---

### If You Have a Weekend
**Goal**: Full framework + team knowledge repository

**Phase 1** - Complete Milestones 1-3
**Phase 2** - Set up knowledge repository
**Phase 3** - Create custom extensions for your domain

**What you get**: Complete development team + company knowledge accessible everywhere.

---

## Milestone 1: Persistent Memory

**Complexity**: Beginner
**Prerequisites**: None
**Goal**: Work survives sessions - decisions, context, and progress persist

### What You'll Achieve

- Memory Copilot installed and running
- /continue loads your previous session
- Decisions and lessons automatically stored
- Never start from zero again

### The Problem This Solves

Claude Code normally forgets everything when you close it. You repeat context, explain decisions, and lose progress. Memory Copilot fixes this.

### Hands-on Exercise

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
mkdir -p ~/.claude && cd ~/.claude
git clone https://github.com/Everyone-Needs-A-Copilot/claude-copilot.git copilot

# 2. Open in Claude Code
cd ~/.claude/copilot && claude
```

Then say:
```
Read @~/.claude/copilot/SETUP.md and set up Claude Copilot on this machine
```

This installs:
- Memory Copilot MCP server (persistent storage)
- Skills Copilot MCP server (knowledge + skills)
- Global commands (/setup-project, /knowledge-copilot, etc.)

### Verification

In Claude Code, run:
```
/mcp
```

You should see:
```
● copilot-memory
● skills-copilot
```

### What You Can Do Now

| Capability | How |
|------------|-----|
| **Store decisions** | Claude automatically stores via `memory_store` |
| **Resume work** | `/continue` loads your last session |
| **Search history** | `memory_search` finds past decisions |
| **Track initiatives** | Automatic progress tracking |

### Understanding Memory Tools

Claude Copilot adds these tools to Claude Code:

| Tool | Purpose | When Used |
|------|---------|-----------|
| `initiative_get` | Retrieve current work | On /continue |
| `initiative_start` | Begin new work | On /protocol |
| `initiative_update` | Save progress | End of session |
| `initiative_complete` | Archive finished work | Task complete |
| `memory_store` | Store decision/lesson | Whenever noteworthy |
| `memory_search` | Find past decisions | When context needed |

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Machine setup completed
- [ ] Both MCP servers show as connected
- [ ] You understand what Memory Copilot does
- [ ] You're ready to set up a project

### What's Next?

Memory alone is valuable, but the real power comes from combining it with structured workflows. That's Milestone 2.

---

## Milestone 2: Agent Workflow

**Complexity**: Beginner+
**Prerequisites**: Memory Copilot installed
**Goal**: Start using /protocol for structured, expert-guided work sessions

### What You'll Achieve

- /protocol breaks down complex requests
- Tasks automatically routed to right specialist
- Structured session with clear next steps
- Work properly saved for /continue

### The Problem This Solves

You say "add user auth" and Claude either gives generic advice or starts coding without planning. Protocol adds structure: classify → route → expert guidance → save progress.

### Hands-on Exercise

```bash
# 1. Open any project in Claude Code
cd ~/your-project && claude

# 2. Set up the project
/setup-project
```

This creates:
```
your-project/
├── .mcp.json              # MCP configuration
├── CLAUDE.md              # Project instructions
└── .claude/
    ├── commands/          # /protocol, /continue
    └── agents/            # 12 specialist agents
```

### Try Your First Protocol Session

```
/protocol
```

When prompted, say:
```
I need to add user authentication to this app
```

Watch what happens:

1. **Classification**: Task identified as "Feature Implementation"
2. **Routing**: Sent to Tech Architect (ta)
3. **Breakdown**: Architecture decisions + task list
4. **Saved**: Everything stored in memory for /continue

### Understanding Protocol Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Request] --> B{Protocol Classifies}
    B -->|Bug Fix| C[Engineer me]
    B -->|Feature| D[Tech Architect ta]
    B -->|Security| E[Security sec]
    B -->|Design| F[UX Designer uxd]
    C --> G[Work + Save]
    D --> G
    E --> G
    F --> G
    G --> H[Continue Later]
```

### Protocol Request Types

| Request Type | Routes To | Example |
|--------------|-----------|---------|
| Bug Fix | Engineer (me) | "Login fails with 404" |
| Feature | Tech Architect (ta) | "Add user profiles" |
| Architecture | Tech Architect (ta) | "Design API structure" |
| Security | Security (sec) | "Review auth flow" |
| Documentation | Documentation (doc) | "Write API docs" |
| Testing | QA Engineer (qa) | "Test edge cases" |
| Design | UX Designer (uxd) | "Design onboarding" |

### Verification

```bash
# 1. Start protocol session
/protocol
# Say: "Add dark mode toggle"

# 2. Let it complete

# 3. Close and reopen Claude Code

# 4. Resume work
/continue
```

You should see your previous session load with full context.

### What You Can Do Now

| Capability | How |
|------------|-----|
| **Start structured work** | `/protocol` + your request |
| **Get expert routing** | Request auto-routed to right agent |
| **Save progress** | Automatic via `initiative_update` |
| **Resume work** | `/continue` loads full context |

### Success Criteria

- [ ] /setup-project completed on a test project
- [ ] Ran /protocol with a request
- [ ] Saw task breakdown from an agent
- [ ] Used /continue to resume work
- [ ] Understand protocol → agent → memory flow

### What's Next?

You've seen one agent in action. Milestone 3 introduces all 12 specialists and shows how they work together.

---

## Milestone 3: Full Framework

**Complexity**: Intermediate
**Prerequisites**: Protocol working
**Goal**: Master all 13 agents and understand when to use each

### What You'll Achieve

- Know all 12 specialist agents
- Understand agent routing patterns
- Use agents for complex multi-domain tasks
- See agents collaborate on solutions

### The Problem This Solves

Complex work requires multiple perspectives: architecture, security, UX, implementation, testing. Managing this yourself is overwhelming. Agents handle routing and collaboration automatically.

### Your Team

| Agent | Role | When Used |
|-------|------|-----------|
| **ta** | Tech Architect | System design, task breakdown, ADRs |
| **me** | Engineer | Implementation, bug fixes, refactoring |
| **qa** | QA Engineer | Testing strategy, edge cases, verification |
| **sec** | Security | Vulnerabilities, threat modeling, OWASP |
| **doc** | Documentation | READMEs, API docs, architecture docs |
| **do** | DevOps | CI/CD, containers, infrastructure |
| **sd** | Service Designer | Customer journeys, experience strategy |
| **uxd** | UX Designer | Task flows, wireframes, accessibility |
| **uids** | UI Designer | Visual design, design systems, tokens |
| **uid** | UI Developer | Component implementation, responsive UI |
| **cw** | Copywriter | Microcopy, error messages, voice/tone |
| **kc** | Knowledge Copilot | Shared knowledge setup |

### Hands-on Exercises

#### Exercise 1: Multi-Agent Feature

```
/protocol
```

Request:
```
Design and implement a user profile page with avatar upload
```

Watch the routing:
1. **ta** (Tech Architect) - Breaks down architecture
2. **uxd** (UX Designer) - Designs the flow
3. **sec** (Security) - Reviews file upload security
4. **uid** (UI Developer) - Implements components
5. **qa** (QA Engineer) - Tests edge cases

#### Exercise 2: Direct Agent Invocation

You can also talk directly to agents:

```
@ta What's the best way to structure a multi-tenant SaaS backend?
```

```
@sec Review this authentication middleware
```

```
@uxd Design an onboarding flow for first-time users
```

#### Exercise 3: Agent Collaboration

Complex requests trigger multiple agents:

```
/protocol
```

Request:
```
We need to add payment processing to the checkout flow
```

Expected routing:
- **ta** - Architecture (payment providers, webhook handling)
- **sec** - Security (PCI compliance, token handling)
- **uxd** - UX (payment form, error states)
- **uid** - Implementation (form components)
- **qa** - Testing (failed payments, edge cases)

### Understanding Agent Routing

Agents route to each other based on expertise:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Any Agent] --> B[ta: Architecture]
    A --> C[sec: Security]
    D[sd: Service Design] --> E[uxd: UX Design]
    E --> F[uids: UI Design]
    F --> G[uid: UI Dev]
    A --> H[me: Engineering]
    A --> I[qa: Testing]
    A --> J[doc: Documentation]
```

### Agent Decision Authority

Each agent knows when to work autonomously vs. escalate:

| Agent | Autonomous | Escalate |
|-------|------------|----------|
| **ta** | Task breakdown, tech selection | Architecture shifts → team |
| **me** | Bug fixes, features | Breaking changes → ta |
| **qa** | Test strategy, scenarios | Release decisions → team |
| **sec** | Vulnerability review | Security incidents → team |
| **doc** | README updates, guides | Major restructuring → team |

### Verification Exercise

Create a complex request that requires multiple domains:

```
/protocol
```

Request:
```
We need to migrate our authentication from sessions to JWTs
```

Expected flow:
1. **ta** classifies as architecture change
2. **ta** breaks down migration strategy
3. **sec** reviews security implications
4. **me** implements changes
5. **qa** creates test scenarios
6. **doc** updates authentication docs

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Understand all 13 agents and their domains
- [ ] Completed multi-agent feature exercise
- [ ] Invoked agents directly with @
- [ ] Saw agents route to each other
- [ ] Understand autonomous vs. escalation decisions

### What You Can Do Now

| Capability | How |
|------------|-----|
| **Complex features** | /protocol handles multi-domain work |
| **Direct expertise** | @ agent for specific guidance |
| **Quality assurance** | qa reviews automatically |
| **Security review** | sec checks vulnerabilities |
| **Complete documentation** | doc writes as features develop |

### What's Next?

You're now using the full framework solo. Milestone 4 adds team capabilities: shared knowledge, company standards, and custom extensions.

---

## Milestone 4: Team Setup

**Complexity**: Intermediate+
**Prerequisites**: All agents working
**Goal**: Set up shared knowledge repository and understand extensions

### What You'll Achieve

- Knowledge repository for company information
- Shared standards accessible in all projects
- Custom agent extensions for your domain
- Team can share one knowledge source

### The Problem This Solves

Every team member explains company context separately. Standards drift. Domain expertise gets lost. Knowledge repositories centralize this and make it available everywhere.

### Two-Tier Knowledge System

| Tier | Location | Purpose | Scope |
|------|----------|---------|-------|
| **Global** | `~/.claude/knowledge` | Company-wide standards | All projects |
| **Project** | `.mcp.json` override | Project-specific | One project |

**Key insight**: Set up global once, every project automatically gets it.

### Hands-on Exercise: Create Knowledge Repository

```
/knowledge-copilot
```

This guided setup:
1. Creates Git repository for your knowledge
2. Walks through documenting:
   - Company information
   - Voice and tone guidelines
   - Product domain knowledge
   - Engineering standards
3. Helps push to GitHub for team sharing
4. Links to `~/.claude/knowledge`

### What Goes In Knowledge?

```
your-company-knowledge/
├── knowledge-manifest.json       # Required metadata
├── COMPANY.md                    # About the company
├── VOICE-AND-TONE.md            # Writing guidelines
├── PRODUCTS.md                   # Product domain
├── ENGINEERING-STANDARDS.md      # Tech standards
└── .claude/
    └── extensions/
        ├── ta.extension.md       # Custom architect guidance
        ├── sec.override.md       # Company security policies
        └── uxd.extension.md      # Design system patterns
```

### Extension Types

| Type | File Pattern | Behavior |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **override** | `agent.override.md` | Replaces entire base agent |
| **extension** | `agent.extension.md` | Adds to base agent (merges sections) |
| **skills** | `agent.skills.json` | Injects additional skills |

### Example Extension: Custom Security Standards

Create `~/.claude/knowledge/.claude/extensions/sec.extension.md`:

```markdown
---
name: sec
type: extension
extends: sec
description: Company security standards
---

## Security Standards

### Authentication
- Use Auth0 for all applications
- JWT tokens expire in 15 minutes
- Refresh tokens valid for 7 days

### Data Privacy
- All PII must be encrypted at rest
- Use our central KMS for key management
- Log access to sensitive data

### Code Review Requirements
- Security-sensitive code needs sec team approval
- Use our SAST tool in CI/CD
- Document threat model in ADRs
```

This extends the base `sec` agent with your company's specific requirements.

### Team Member Setup

Once knowledge repository is on GitHub:

```bash
# 1. Clone team knowledge
git clone git@github.com:company/knowledge.git ~/company-knowledge

# 2. Link it
ln -sf ~/company-knowledge ~/.claude/knowledge

# 3. Done - every project now has access
```

### Verification

```
/protocol
```

Request:
```
@sec Review this authentication code
```

Security agent should now reference your company standards (Auth0, JWT expiry, etc.) instead of just generic advice.

### Check Extension Status

Use Skills Copilot tools:

```
Ask Claude: "Show me all loaded extensions"
```

Or:
```
Ask Claude: "Check manifest status"
```

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Created knowledge repository with /knowledge-copilot
- [ ] Documented company information
- [ ] Created at least one agent extension
- [ ] Pushed to GitHub for team sharing
- [ ] Verified agents use custom knowledge
- [ ] Team member can clone and link

### What You Can Do Now

| Capability | How |
|------------|-----|
| **Company context** | Agents reference your company info |
| **Custom standards** | Extensions add domain requirements |
| **Team sharing** | One knowledge repo, all team members |
| **Consistent guidance** | Everyone gets same expert advice |

### What's Next?

Milestone 5 covers advanced customization: private skills, custom workflows, and integration patterns.

---

## Milestone 5: Power User

**Complexity**: Advanced
**Prerequisites**: Knowledge repository working
**Goal**: Master advanced customization and workflow optimization

### What You'll Achieve

- Private skills database for proprietary patterns
- Custom workflows for your domain
- Integration with external tools
- Complete framework mastery

### The Problem This Solves

Every team has proprietary patterns, internal tools, and unique workflows. Power user features let you codify and automate these.

### Advanced Capabilities

#### 1. Private Skills Database

Store proprietary skills in PostgreSQL:

```json
// .mcp.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "skills-copilot": {
      "env": {
        "POSTGRES_URL": "postgresql://user:pass@localhost/skills",
        "LOCAL_SKILLS_PATH": "./.claude/skills"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then use `skill_save` to store company-specific patterns:

```
Ask Claude: "Save this error handling pattern as a private skill"
```

#### 2. Skills Marketplace Integration

Access 25,000+ public skills:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "skills-copilot": {
      "env": {
        "SKILLSMP_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Skills auto-invoke based on context. No manual management.

#### 3. Custom Workflows

Create project-specific commands in `.claude/commands/`:

Example: `.claude/commands/deploy.md`

```markdown
---
name: deploy
description: Deploy with our company process
---

# Deploy Process

1. Load deployment skill: skill_get("company-deployment")
2. Check for sec approval in initiative
3. Run pre-deployment checklist
4. Execute deployment steps
5. Update initiative with deployment info
6. Notify team via memory_store
```

#### 4. Workspace Identity

Preserve memory across renames/moves:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "copilot-memory": {
      "env": {
        "WORKSPACE_ID": "explicit-project-name"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Default is path-based hash. Set explicitly for portability.

### Hands-on Exercises

#### Exercise 1: Create Private Skill

1. Document your company's API error handling pattern
2. Ask Claude to save it: "Save this as a private skill named 'company-error-handling'"
3. Test retrieval: "Load the company-error-handling skill"
4. Use it: "Apply our error handling to this endpoint"

#### Exercise 2: Custom Command

Create `.claude/commands/release.md`:

```markdown
---
name: release
description: Our release process
---

You are managing a release following our company process.

## Steps

1. Verify all tests pass (check with qa)
2. Review security concerns (check with sec)
3. Update changelog (check with doc)
4. Create release branch
5. Deploy to staging
6. Run smoke tests
7. Get approval
8. Deploy to production
9. Update initiative: "Release vX.X.X completed"

Follow these steps and confirm each before proceeding.
```

Then use: `/release`

#### Exercise 3: Multi-Project Memory

Set up related projects to share memory:

Project A `.mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "copilot-memory": {
      "env": {
        "WORKSPACE_ID": "shared-platform"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Project B `.mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "copilot-memory": {
      "env": {
        "WORKSPACE_ID": "shared-platform"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Now decisions in Project A are accessible in Project B.

### Advanced Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Agent Specialization

Override agents for narrow domains:

`~/.claude/knowledge/.claude/extensions/me.override.md`:

```markdown
---
name: me
type: override
description: React Native specialist
---

## Identity

**Role:** React Native Engineer
**Mission:** Build performant cross-platform mobile apps

## React Native Expertise

- Always use TypeScript
- Follow our RN performance guidelines
- Use our component library
- Test on both iOS and Android
- [... specialized guidance ...]
```

#### Pattern 2: Workflow Automation

Chain commands together:

`.claude/commands/feature.md`:

```markdown
---
name: feature
description: Full feature workflow
---

Execute our complete feature workflow:

1. /protocol - Let ta break down architecture
2. Load security checklist - skill_get("security-checklist")
3. Implement with me
4. Test with qa
5. Document with doc
6. Update initiative with "Feature complete"

Confirm each step before proceeding.
```

#### Pattern 3: Knowledge Layering

Override global knowledge at project level:

`.mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "skills-copilot": {
      "env": {
        "KNOWLEDGE_REPO_PATH": "./project-knowledge"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Resolution order:
1. Project knowledge (`KNOWLEDGE_REPO_PATH`)
2. Global knowledge (`~/.claude/knowledge`)
3. Base agents

## Learning Tips

### Do

- **Follow the milestone order** - Each builds on previous
- **Complete verification steps** - Confirm it works before moving on
- **Experiment safely** - Use test projects for learning
- **Document your patterns** - Create company-specific guides
- **Share with team** - Learn together, share discoveries

### Don't

- **Skip Memory setup** - Nothing else works without it
- **Rush to extensions** - Master base agents first
- **Copy configs blindly** - Understand what each setting does
- **Work in isolation** - Collaborate on knowledge repository
- **Forget to /continue** - Always save progress at session end

---

## Common Challenges

### Challenge 1: "MCP servers won't connect"

**Solution:**
1. Check `.mcp.json` uses absolute paths (not `~`)
2. Verify `dist/index.js` files exist
3. Run: `cd ~/.claude/copilot/mcp-servers/copilot-memory && npm run build`
4. Restart Claude Code

### Challenge 2: "/continue doesn't load context"

**Solution:**
1. Verify copilot-memory is connected: `/mcp`
2. Check you ran /protocol (not just chatted)
3. Look for `initiative_update` calls in previous session
4. Ensure WORKSPACE_ID is consistent

### Challenge 3: "Agents give generic advice"

**Solution:**
1. Create knowledge repository with company context
2. Add agent extensions with domain specifics
3. Use /protocol (not direct chat) for proper routing
4. Be specific in requests: "using our React patterns" vs "add feature"

### Challenge 4: "Which agent do I use?"

**Solution:**
- Use /protocol - routing is automatic
- For direct invocation: @ta (design), @me (code), @qa (test), @sec (security), @doc (write)
- Check the agent routing diagram in Milestone 3

### Challenge 5: "Team members have different experiences"

**Solution:**
1. All use same knowledge repository (clone from GitHub)
2. All link: `ln -sf ~/company-knowledge ~/.claude/knowledge`
3. Document team setup in knowledge repo README
4. Version control knowledge repo for consistency

---

## What's Next After Completion?

Once you've completed all milestones:

1. **Team Enablement** - Train teammates, create onboarding docs
2. **Knowledge Curation** - Continuously improve company knowledge
3. **Workflow Optimization** - Refine agents and commands based on usage
4. **Community Contribution** - Share generic patterns back to framework
5. **Advanced Integration** - Build custom MCP servers for your tools
6. **Stay Updated** - Watch for framework updates and new capabilities
