## How Agents Collaborate

Agents don't work in isolation—they route to each other based on expertise.

### Technical Flow

## Custom Agents

Teams can add domain-specific agents. Example with a custom `@agent-cpa`:

```
User Request: "Add expense reporting with tax categorization"
         │
         ▼
    @agent-ta ──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    (designs data model, API structure)                      │
         │                                                   │
         ├──→ @agent-cpa (tax categories, compliance rules) │  ← Your custom agent
         │         │                                         │
         │         └──→ returns IRS category mappings        │
         │                                                   │
         └──→ @agent-me (implementation) ◄──────────────────┘
                   │
                   ├──→ @agent-sec (financial data protection)
                   │
                   └──→ @agent-cpa (validates tax logic)
```

Your CPA agent encodes tax law expertise, IRS requirements, and accounting standards—knowledge that doesn't exist in generic AI tools.

See [Customization](CUSTOMIZATION.md) for how to create custom agents.

## Invoking Agents

Agents are automatically routed when you use `/protocol`. You can also invoke them directly:

| Method | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Via protocol | `/protocol` then describe your task |
| Direct mention | `@agent-ta design the auth system` |
| Task tool | `subagent_type: "ta"` |
