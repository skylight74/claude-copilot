## Agent Selection

### Agent Routing Matrix

| Task Type | Primary Agent | Secondary Agent(s) | Why This Flow |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Bug Fix** | `qa` | → `me` | QA reproduces, Engineer fixes |
| **New Feature** | `sd` | → `uxd` → `uid` | Service → UX → Implementation |
| **API Design** | `ta` | → `me` → `doc` | Architecture → Code → Docs |
| **Security Review** | `sec` | | Security expertise |
| **Performance Issue** | `ta` | → `me` | Design analysis → Implementation |
| **UI Component** | `uids` | → `uid` | Visual design → Code |
| **Documentation** | `doc` | | Technical writing |
| **Deployment** | `do` | | DevOps expertise |
| **Architecture Decision** | `ta` | | System design |
| **User Research** | `sd` | | Experience strategy |
| **Copy/Messaging** | `cw` | | Content writing |

### Scenario-Based Agent Selection

| Scenario | Start With | Reasoning |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| "Users can't login" | `/protocol` (DEFECT) → `@agent-qa` | Needs reproduction and diagnosis |
| "Add dark mode" | `/protocol` (EXPERIENCE) → `@agent-sd` | Experience change requires journey analysis |
| "Optimize database queries" | `/protocol` (FEATURE) → `@agent-ta` | Architecture-level optimization |
| "Deploy to production" | `/protocol` (DEVOPS) → `@agent-do` | Infrastructure task |
| "Security audit" | `/protocol` (SECURITY) → `@agent-sec` | Security expertise required |
| "Write API docs" | `/protocol` (DOCUMENTATION) → `@agent-doc` | Documentation specialist |
| "Refactor auth module" | `/protocol` (ARCHITECTURE) → `@agent-ta` | Design decision needed |
| "Fix button alignment" | `/protocol` (DEFECT) → `@agent-uid` | UI implementation fix |

## Extension vs Override vs Skills

### Extension Type Decision Tree

```
Do you need to customize agent behavior?
├─ NO → Use base agents as-is
│
└─ YES → Do you want to replace the entire agent?
         ├─ YES → Use OVERRIDE (.override.md)
         │        Example: Completely custom methodology
         │
         └─ NO → Do you want to add/enhance sections?
                  ├─ YES → Use EXTENSION (.extension.md)
                  │        Example: Add checklists, templates
                  │
                  └─ NO → Do you just need to inject skills?
                           └─ Use SKILLS (.skills.json)
                                Example: Company-specific tools
```

### Extension Type Comparison

| Goal | Extension Type | File Pattern | Scope | Difficulty |
|------|----------------|--------------|-------|------------|
| Add company checklist | `extension` | `agent.extension.md` | Section merge | Easy |
| Replace methodology | `override` | `agent.override.md` | Full replacement | Hard |
| Inject team tools | `skills` | `agent.skills.json` | Skill list only | Medium |
| Enhance templates | `extension` | `agent.extension.md` | Section merge | Easy |
| Custom process flow | `override` | `agent.override.md` | Full replacement | Hard |
| Add domain knowledge | `skills` | `agent.skills.json` | Skill list only | Medium |

## Work Session Decisions

### Starting Work Decision Matrix

| Situation | Use | Why |
|-----------|-----|-----|
| Brand new task | `/protocol` | Classify and route to expert |
| Continuing yesterday's work | `/continue` | Load context from memory |
| Quick question | Just ask | No need for protocol |
| Exploring ideas | Just ask | Protocol is for execution |
| Complex multi-step task | `/protocol` | Agent expertise needed |
| Resume after interruption | `/continue` | Context restoration |

### Protocol vs Direct Conversation

| Use /protocol When... | Use Direct Conversation When... |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|
| Building a feature | Asking a question |
| Fixing a bug | Exploring ideas |
| Making architecture changes | Getting quick help |
| Need expert guidance | Simple task |
| Multi-step process | Single action |
| Want structured approach | Want flexibility |

---

## Knowledge Repository Decisions

### When to Create Knowledge Repository

| Indicator | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Team > 1 person | Create knowledge repo |
| Company has style guide | Document in knowledge repo |
| Custom methodologies | Create agent extensions |
| Repeated explanations | Document once in knowledge |
| Onboarding takes days | Create knowledge repo |
| Inconsistent outputs | Define standards in knowledge |

### Knowledge vs Skills vs Memory

| Type of Information | Store In | Why |
|---------------------|----------|-----|
| Company values | Knowledge | Permanent, team-wide |
| Voice/tone guidelines | Knowledge | Permanent, team-wide |
| Design system | Knowledge | Permanent, team-wide |
| Reusable code patterns | Skills | On-demand, reusable |
| Project decisions | Memory | Project-specific, temporal |
| Lessons learned | Memory | Project-specific, evolving |
| API standards | Knowledge | Team standard |
| Deployment process | Skills | Reusable workflow |
| Why we chose X | Memory | Project context |

---

## Troubleshooting Decisions

### When Something Goes Wrong

| Problem | Check First | Then Try | Last Resort |
|---------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| Command not found | Machine setup complete? | `/setup` in `~/.claude/copilot` | Reinstall |
| MCP not connecting | `.mcp.json` paths absolute? | Rebuild servers | Check Node version |
| Agent not routing | Is task description clear? | Rephrase request | Use agent directly |
| Memory not persisting | `WORKSPACE_ID` set? | Check `.mcp.json` | Rebuild memory server |
| Knowledge not found | Symlink exists? | `/knowledge-copilot` | Manual link |
| Skills not loading | Skills server running? | `/mcp` to verify | Check logs |

## Quick Reference Tables

### Installation Decision Matrix

| You Are... | Steps Required | Commands to Run |
|------------|----------------|-----------------|
| New solo user | Clone → Setup → Project | `/setup` → `/setup-project` |
| New team member | Clone → Setup → Link Knowledge → Project | `/setup` → `/knowledge-copilot` → `/setup-project` |
| Existing user, new project | Project setup only | `/setup-project` |
| Updating framework | Update → Rebuild → Sync projects | `/update-copilot` → `/update-project` |

### Daily Workflow Matrix

| Beginning of Day | During Day | End of Day |
|------------------|------------|------------|
| `/continue` to resume | Work naturally with agents | `initiative_update` to save progress |
| Or `/protocol` for new task | Route complex work to specialists | Document decisions in memory |
| Check `/mcp` if needed | Use skills as needed | Note lessons learned |

---

## Best Practices Summary

### Do This

| Context | Best Practice |
|---------|--------------|
| Starting work | Use `/continue` to load context |
| Complex tasks | Use `/protocol` to engage experts |
| Team standards | Create knowledge repository |
| Reusable patterns | Save as skills |
| Project decisions | Store in memory with context |
| End of session | Update initiative with progress |

### Don't Do This

| Anti-Pattern | Instead Do |
|--------------|-----------|
| Hardcode paths in extensions | Use relative paths |
| Store secrets in knowledge | Use environment variables |
| Override agents unnecessarily | Use extensions first |
| Skip memory updates | Update at end of session |
| Create skills for one-offs | Just solve the problem |
| Ignore agent routing | Trust the protocol |
