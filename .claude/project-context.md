## Environment Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Python | Ready | 3.9+ required |
| uv | Required | Package manager |
| Rich | Ready | Terminal UI library |
| pytest | Required | Install with dev dependencies |

## Active Development Areas

1. **Core Monitoring** (`src/claude_monitor/core/`)
   - Token usage calculations
   - ML-based predictions
   - Plan detection

2. **Data Handling** (`src/claude_monitor/data/`)
   - Claude usage data parsing
   - Agent data analysis

3. **UI Components** (`src/claude_monitor/ui/`)
   - Rich terminal interface
   - Layout management
   - Agent display panels

## Known Issues

*None currently tracked*

## Architecture Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Human-centered development | Human Advocates have veto power on experience | 2025-12-13 |
| Full design trio (SD+UX+UI) | Terminal UI still serves humans, needs design thinking | 2025-12-13 |
| Three-tier CLAUDE.md | 85% token reduction per session | 2025-12-13 |
| Rich for UI | Terminal-native, no web server needed | Original |
| uv for packages | Fast, reliable Python package management | Original |

## Next Steps

1. [x] Complete agent definitions (all 6 agents configured)
2. [x] Create context reference cards
3. [x] Set up MCP server launcher
4. [ ] Configure pre-commit hooks
5. [ ] Write initial test suite
6. [ ] Run Service Designer to map developer journey
7. [ ] Run UX Designer to optimize terminal interaction
8. [ ] Run UI Designer to define Rich styling

## Session Handoff Notes

**Human-Centered Environment Established:**
- Full design trio configured (Service Designer → UX Designer → UI Designer)
- Human Advocates have veto power on experience decisions
- Technical Implementers serve the human-centered vision
- Workflow: SD+Architect collaborate first, then parallel tracks, then integration

**Next Focus Areas:**
1. Run design agents to establish the developer experience vision
2. Then implement based on design agent outputs
3. Always route experience decisions through Human Advocates

**Key Philosophy:**
> "Software exists to serve humans. Every technical decision must answer to the human experience it enables."
